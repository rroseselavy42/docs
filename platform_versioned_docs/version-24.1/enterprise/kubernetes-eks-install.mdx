This installation guide describes how to install Seqera Platform on Enterprise on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). When you complete the steps in this guide you'll have an installation suitable for product use on EKS.

## Prerequisites

- **SMTP server**: If you don't have an email server, use [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/).

- **MySQL database**: An external database, such as one provided by [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), is highly recommended for production deployments.

- **SSL certificate**: HTTP must not be used in production environments. An SSL certificate is required for your Seqera instance to handle HTTPS traffic. See [SSL/TLS configuration](../configuration/ssl_tls.mdx#aws-deployments-manage-ssl-certificates-with-amazon-certificate-manager-acm) for more information.

- **Optional: AWS Parameter Store**: Store sensitive Seqera configuration values as SecureString [AWS Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) parameters. See [AWS Parameter Store configuration](../configuration/aws_parameter_store.mdx) for instructions. This is recommended for production environments. 

- **Optional: DNS**: DNS is required to support human-readable domain names and load-balanced traffic. If you don't have access to a pre-existing DNS service, use [Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html).

### Prerequisites for EKS

If you're installing Seqera Enterprise with Kubernetes, an [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) cluster is required. See the [EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html) to provision your own cluster.

- Kubernetes 1.19 or later

- **Subnet requirements**

  - At least 2 subnets across two different Availability Zones
  - Subnets must be tagged for [AWS Load Balancer Controller auto-discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/network_reqs.html)
  - Public subnets must be configured to [auto-assign IPs on launch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/upcoming-changes-to-ip-assignment-for-eks-managed-node-groups/)
  - Public and private subnets must allow egress traffic to the public internet

- **RBAC requirements**

  - The cluster must be created by a non-root user
  - `aws-auth` must be updated to [allow access to additional IAM users/roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html) (if needed)

- **Addons**

  - Install the [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)
  - Install the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)

- **Ingress**

  - ALB provisioning via the [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html)
  - ALB integration with the [Amazon Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)

Additionally, the ingress assumes the presence of SSL certificates, DNS resolution, and ALB logging. If you've chosen not to use some or all of these features, you'll need to modify the manifest accordingly before applying it to the cluster.

## AWS setup

Set up commonly-used AWS services for Seqera deployment.

### Fetch Seqera config values from AWS Parameter Store

From version 23.1, you can retrieve Seqera Enterprise configuration values remotely from the AWS Parameter Store. See [AWS Parameter Store configuration](../configuration/aws_parameter_store.mdx) for instructions. 

### Amazon SES

Seqera Enterprise supports AWS Simple Email Service (SES) as an alternative to traditional SMTP servers for sending application emails. 

:::caution
If you use AWS SES in sandbox mode, both the _sender_ and the _receiver_ email addresses must be verified via AWS SES. Sandbox is not recommended for production use. See the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html) for instructions to move out of the sandbox.
:::

- See [Obtaining SES SMTP credentials using the SES console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/smtp-credentials.html#smtp-credentials-console) for instructions to set up SES to send emails from your preferred address. 

- To prevent emails from SES being flagged as spam, see these AWS instructions for setting up an email authentication method:

   - [DKIM for a domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-dkim-easy-setup-domain.html) 
   
   - [SPF authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-spf.html)

#### Managed Redis services

Seqera supports managed Redis services such as [Amazon ElastiCache][aws-elasticache].

- Use a single-node cluster, as multi-node clusters are not supported
- Use an instance with at least 6GB capacity ([cache.m4.large][aws-cache-instances] or greater)

### Amazon RDS

External databases for Seqera Enterprise deployments require:

- A **MySQL8 Community** DB instance
- At least 2 vCPUs, 8 GB memory, and 30 GB SSD storage
- Manual MySQL user and database schema creation. See [Database configuration](../configuration/overview.mdx#seqera-and-redis-databases) for more details.

:::caution 
Recommended instance class and storage requirements depend on the number of parallel pipelines you expect to run.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="AWS console" label="AWS console" default>

See [Creating an Amazon RDS DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateDBInstance.html) to guide you through the external database setup for your production deployment. 

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="AWS CLI" label="AWS CLI" default>

To create a DB instance with the AWS CLI, call the [create-db-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/create-db-instance.html) command, replacing `INSTANCE_NAME`, `SECURITY_GROUP`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` with your unique values:

```console
aws rds create-db-instance \
    --engine mysql \ 
    --db-instance-identifier INSTANCE_NAME \
    --allocated-storage 30 \
    --db-instance-class db.m5d.large \
    --vpc-security-group-ids SECURITY_GROUP \
    --db-subnet-group SUBNET_GROUP \
    --master-username DB_USER \
    --master-user-password DB_PASSWORD \
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After your database is created:

- Update the inbound rules for the underlying EC2 instance to allow MySQL connections.
- Update your Seqera [configuration](../configuration/overview.mdx#seqera-and-redis-databases) with the database hostname, username, and password.

<ConfigureRegistry />

<!-- replace with proper manifests for EKS -->
## Deploy Seqera

Seqera Platform consists of deployments for a cron service, a backend service, and a frontend service.

1. Create the manifest files:
    - Create a file named `tower-cron.yml` with the following Kubernetes manifest:

      <details>
      <summary>Show `tower-cron.yml` file</summary>
      ```js file=./_templates/k8s/k8s_min/tower-cron.yml showLineNumbers
      ```
      </details>

    - Create a file named `tower-svc.yml` with the following Kubernetes manifest:

      <details>
      <summary>Show `tower-svc.yml` file</summary>
      ```js file=./_templates/k8s/k8s_min/tower-svc.yml showLineNumbers
      ```
      </details>
